# Welcome to Nooty - Notes Everywhere! üìî

Hello fellow note-takers and organization enthusiasts! I'm excited to introduce Nooty, a project born from a simple, yet powerful objective: to create a note-taking app that effortlessly syncs across all platforms.

## Why Nooty? üåü

I'm creating Nooty to tackle a specific challenge - the lack of integration between note-taking applications across different platforms. Here‚Äôs what makes Nooty special(special, in my view):

- **Reaching as many as possible platforms**: While I recognize that some people have reservations about technologies like Electron and non-native applications, I believe these technologies open up a wealth of opportunities. Embracing them allows us to create the best tools possible to address various challenges. With this philosophy, I aim to extend Nooty's reach from web browsers to desktops and mobile apps, offering a seamless experience across all platforms.
- **Simplicity Is Key**: Using your email to sync your notes. No complicated setups, just your notes, everywhere you go.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Here's what's under the hood of Nooty:

- **TypeScript**: For clean, maintainable, and enjoyable coding.
- **Expo**: To efficiently manage builds across all platforms.

### Project Structure
Nooty is organized as a monorepo using Yarn Workspaces. This structure simplifies dependency management and streamlines the workflow across our two main packages:
- `packages/nooty-app`: The main application of Nooty.
- `packages/nooty-editor`: The WYSIWYG editor used by Nooty.

2. **Create a Branch**: Working on something specific? Branch off from `main`.
3. **Write Your Code**: Go ahead and code up your idea or fix.
4. **Ensure Quality**: Run tests, and add new ones for your feature.
5. **Pull Request**: Send it over. Explain what and why for clarity.
6. **Let's Discuss**: I‚Äôll review it, and we can refine it together.
